=== Load Balance Check at Step 100 ===
Initial atom distribution:
Process 0: 18525 atoms
Process 1: 18398 atoms
Process 2: 18431 atoms
Process 3: 18460 atoms
Process 4: 18390 atoms
Process 5: 18376 atoms
Process 6: 18367 atoms
Process 7: 18509 atoms
Load imbalance metrics:
Max atoms: 18525, Min atoms: 18367
Current imbalance ratio: 1.008602

=== Load Balance Check at Step 150 ===
Initial atom distribution:
Process 0: 18459 atoms
Process 1: 18409 atoms
Process 2: 18392 atoms
Process 3: 18481 atoms
Process 4: 18367 atoms
Process 5: 18407 atoms
Process 6: 18374 atoms
Process 7: 18567 atoms
Load imbalance metrics:
Max atoms: 18567, Min atoms: 18367
Current imbalance ratio: 1.010889

=== Load Balance Check at Step 300 ===
Initial atom distribution:
Process 0: 18505 atoms
Process 1: 18420 atoms
Process 2: 18309 atoms
Process 3: 18583 atoms
Process 4: 18357 atoms
Process 5: 18372 atoms
Process 6: 18351 atoms
Process 7: 18559 atoms
Load imbalance metrics:
Max atoms: 18583, Min atoms: 18309
Current imbalance ratio: 1.014965
No load balancing needed at this step.
