Process 2: 36827 atoms
Process 3: 36951 atoms
Process 4: 36805 atoms
Process 5: 36858 atoms
Process 6: 36789 atoms
Process 7: 36908 atoms
Load imbalance metrics:
Max atoms: 36960, Min atoms: 36789
Current imbalance ratio: 1.004648

=== Load Balance Check at Step 150 ===
Initial atom distribution:
Process 0: 36917 atoms
Process 1: 36791 atoms
Process 2: 36883 atoms
Process 3: 36911 atoms
Process 4: 36738 atoms
Process 5: 36957 atoms
Process 6: 36776 atoms
Process 7: 36939 atoms
Load imbalance metrics:
Max atoms: 36957, Min atoms: 36738
Current imbalance ratio: 1.005961
No load balancing needed at this step.

=== Load Balance Check at Step 200 ===
Initial atom distribution:
Process 0: 36948 atoms
Process 1: 36773 atoms
Process 2: 36892 atoms
Process 3: 36884 atoms
Process 4: 36750 atoms
Process 5: 36925 atoms
Process 6: 36791 atoms
Process 7: 36949 atoms
Load imbalance metrics:
Max atoms: 36949, Min atoms: 36750
Current imbalance ratio: 1.005415

=== Load Balance Check at Step 250 ===
Initial atom distribution:
Process 0: 36920 atoms
Process 1: 36779 atoms
Process 2: 36908 atoms
Process 3: 36868 atoms
Process 4: 36742 atoms
Process 5: 36911 atoms
Process 6: 36807 atoms
Process 7: 36977 atoms
Load imbalance metrics:
Max atoms: 36977, Min atoms: 36742
Current imbalance ratio: 1.006396
No load balancing needed at this step.

=== Load Balance Check at Step 350 ===
Initial atom distribution:
Process 0: 36961 atoms
Process 1: 36762 atoms
Process 2: 36821 atoms
Process 3: 36952 atoms
Process 4: 36729 atoms
Process 5: 36936 atoms
Process 6: 36756 atoms
Process 7: 36995 atoms
Load imbalance metrics:
Max atoms: 36995, Min atoms: 36729
Current imbalance ratio: 1.007242
No load balancing needed at this step.
